# nucleotide sequence converter

The program aims to simulate the central dogma underlying the process of transcription and translation. The transition from DNA > RNA > (Amino acids) Proteins. 

Please make sure all the files are extracted into the same folder prior to execution. 
Any DNA/RNA sequences will be readable as long as filename.seq or its location address is correctly entered.  



The program contains the following features:

-6-frame reading translation. (reversed reading for last 3 frames)

-Amino acid notation options. (1-letter/3-letters)

-Selection of specific reading frame(s). (Frame 1-6)

-Amino acid counter.

-ID all possible Open Reading Frames (ORFs) for all 6 frames. 

-Computation of the largest ORF and its codons' frequency.
